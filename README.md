Traffic Flow Prediction in New York

Using LSTM and GRU to predict traffic flows in New York City. 

The two fully relevant files here are 'code_with_output.ipynb' and 'code.py'.

I originally programmed this in code_with_output.ipynb. You may see the outputs produced in that code.

Note -- You'll need to download the traffic csv file from here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Automated-Traffic-Volume-Counts/7ym2-wayt
